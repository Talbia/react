### Basic Documentation About Node.js and NPM

```ssh
Node.js
```

> Node.js® is a JavaScript-based environment use to create web-servers and networked applications. It is also used to perform helpful tasks on your computer such as concatenating and minifying JavaScript files and compiling Sass files into CSS.

NPM (Node Package Manager)
