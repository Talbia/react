### A Markdown File for Basic ReactJS and React Native Documentation

```sh
ReactJS
```

- ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible _JavaScript library_ for building reusable UI components. 

- It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. 

- It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.

```sh
React Native
```

- React Native is a JavaScript Framework which is used to develop mobile applications for iOS and Android.

- React Native apps are not web application. They run on a mobile device, and it does not load over the browser. 

- React Native apps are the real native app, the JavaScript code stays as JavaScript, and run in some extra thread by the compiled app. The user interface and everything are compiled to native code.
