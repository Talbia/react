### Creating Our First _Expo_ Project!

Here in the terminal window, type

- `expo init DoneWithIt`
> That's the name of the app we're going to build. 

Choose a workflow for building this app -
> We can use one of the `managed workflows or bare workflows`

```ssh
- Managed workflow: This takes care of all the complexity behind the scene. With a managed workflow we're not going to need those iOS or Android projects. We only have a pure JavaScript project.

- Bare workflow: In this, we're going to have a bare bone react native project, so we'll have those iOS and Android projects. 
```

For now, I'm using `blank managed workflow` to bring extra complexity.
