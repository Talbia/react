## _Simple React Native Tutorial:_

#### There are two ways to build a react native app 

```ssh
 1. Plain React Native CLI or Command Line Interface
 ```
> This approach is suitable for people who have some experience with iOS or Android programming.

```ssh
 2. Expo CLI
 ```
> Expo is a set of tools and a framework that sits on top of react native and hides a lot of complexity from us to make it incredibly fast and easy to build react native apps.

Here I'm using Expo to build a simple React Native App: 

```ssh
To set up your development environment:
```

- Running node version 12 or higher

- In the terminal window, run node `dash v` to check the version
> node -v

> _Note: if Node js isn't installed on your computer, it will display `node:command not found` on your terminal_

```ssh
Installation Steps to download Node
```
Open the Terminal app: 

- a) `brew update` this updates Homebrew with the latest version of Node

- b) `brew install node`

> Time to test it
- a) `node -v` in terminal to see if node is installed
> This should print the version number something like v12.13.0

- b) `npm -v` in terminal to see if npm is installed
> This should print the version number something like 6.12.0
